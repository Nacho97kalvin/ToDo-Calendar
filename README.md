# ToDo List on firebase

This proyect was the first working with react js and firebase, so the arquitecture of the src directory is not so good and some patterns design too, dont even talk about the styles... But against all represent a challange for my career of a front-end developer so its important to me make it public.

Dependencies used:
- React js
- Firebase RealTime DataBase
- FullCalendar

Here i use Context API from react like a data provider, and realtime database from firebase for fetch the data and stored on that service.
